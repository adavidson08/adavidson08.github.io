            <h1>Winter</h1>
            <p> Winter is the coldest season that takes place out of the four seasons. Winter takes place from the end of November till the end of February. During the Winter the Earth is tilted away from the sun. Because the Earth is titled away from the Sun, The rays from the sun have to travel further through the atmosphere before it reaches the Earth's surface. Since it takes longer, the hours of daylight are shorter and the temperature is colder. Depending on the loaction, winter can either be harsh, or very mild. Winter is good for the world around us. Many plants need shorter days and low temperatures to become dormant. This way plants can store up energy for new growth. If a fruit tree doesn't have enough chilling time, it will produce fewer, weaker buds. During winter, the cold settles in followed usually with some snow and of course ice. Tempuratures below freezing cause lost of ice from the snow. Winter is not necessarily a very popular season but winter sports are very fun to participate in! </p>
