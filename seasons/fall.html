            <h1>Fall</h1>
            <p>Fall is one of the most popular and loved seasons as it take place inbetween Summer and Winter. Fall takes place from Ocotber through November, and sometimes can end fairly quickly depending on where you are located. During fall the trees leaves start to turn colors as illustrated in the picuture below, showing that it is almost time for winter.The weather also begins to get colder and many plants stop making food. Autumn is the time when deciduous trees shed their leaves. The leaves change from green to red, orange, yellow or brown before falling. In addition, there is less sunlight because the days are shorter. Fall exists because of the tilt of the Earth. This means that the Earth will lean towards the Sun (Summer) or lean away from the Sun (Winter) 6 months later. In between these, Spring and Autumn will occur. The Earth revolves around the Sun. The North pole always points the same way as the Earth revolves around the Sun.</p>
