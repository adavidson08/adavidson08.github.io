            <h1>Spring</h1>
            <p>Spring is one of the four seasons, it follows winter and is right before summer. During spring, the trees, flowers, and other plant life begin to bloom! The trees that bloom flowers take a shade of white or pink flowers, with green leaves underneath them. Spring is a time when flowers bloom and trees begin to grow and reproduce. The days grow longer and the temperature in most areas become more temperate. You can also contemplate the melting of ice and thawing of the ground. Spring is an interesting season, it is very indecisive with what weather conditions take place. Sometimes it is super sunny and a beautiful day, and sometimes its very rainy. Spring takes place from the beginning of March till the end of May. The arrival of spring brings more daylight, so we can enjoy the energy that is no longer needed to fight off drowsiness. The increased light also triggers the release of serotonin, a brain chemical that helps us feel happier.
