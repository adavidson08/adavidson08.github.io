            <h1>Summer</h1>
            <p>Summer is the hottest season out of the four seasons. Summer takes place from the beginning of June until the end of September. Summer is beautiful and is a very popular season. During this time, popular things to do is go swimming, boating, hiking, backpacking, and playing sports. Depending on the location, summer can also vary in temperatures, some places getting a high of 83 degrees, while others will get a high of 102 degrees. Summer takes place because the summer equinox occurs when the sun passes directly above the equator because of the tilt of the Earth. When the seasons are based on the Earth's position in relation to the sun, it is called astronomical summer. </p>
