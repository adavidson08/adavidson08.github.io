            <h1>About the Seasons! </h1>
            <p>There are four seasons that take place. Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter. These seasons take place during different times in the year. During each one of these seasons, tempurature change takes place ranging from hot to cold. Nature also begins to change in these four seasons, for example in Spring everything starts to bloom and is very green, whereas in winter it is very cold and there is not anything blooming, instead plant life is hibernating for winter. This website will give you a good understanding of the four seasons portraying when that specific season takes place and what goes on during that season!
