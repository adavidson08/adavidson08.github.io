    <h1> Review of State Websites </h1>

    <h2><a href=https://www.alabama.gov targets="_blank"> 1.Alabama </a></h2>

    <p><b> Alabama Analysis: </b></p>
    <p> My favorite wibsite set up by far was Alabama. I thought that the home page of the website was very eye catching because each category had the title and then a picture of what the subject was that the title stated. For example, for covid-19 infomration, there was a picture of a virus behind the the title. They utilized a lot of picutres, which I really liked. The website itself loaded very quickly. I thought that the menu was very easy to navigate. One thing that I really liked was that below the menu bar they have a huge search bar and then a list of popular searches below it, which I thought would be very helpful for the user. The website also had a big section for helpful links, which included links for Online services, Education, Residents, Employment, and Busienss. When enlarging the screen, the website was easy to nagvigate and did well expaning into the full screen. When minimizing the screen, the website did a good job adjusting, all it did was make the website itself longer vertically. </p>
    <h2><a href=https://www.mass.gov targets="_blank">2. Massachusetts </a></h2>

    <p><b> Massachusetts Analysis: </b></p>

    <p> I thought that Massachusetts had a great website. I thought that the fornt of the webite was very eyecatching and had a cool picture behind the search bar. I also thought that the menu was very easy to read and acess, also not hard to navigate. They stated the current covid-19 order, unemploywment benefits, personal income tax, cybersecurity, and many more. I thought that all of the information presented on the front of the website was necessary and easy to navigate. The website itself loads very quickly and doe not lag. When I minimized the screen it did a good job of adjusting to the screen and still eye catching to potential viewers. I found the website easy to navigate and not too confusing, but I don't like how the menu was kind of hard to find, it was in the upper left hand corner and had just three small little lines. </p>

    <h2><a href=https://mn.gov/portal/ targets="_blank">3. Minnesota </a></h2>

    <p><b>Minnesota Analysis: </b></p>
    <p> Minnesota had a very average website. I thought that it was a nice touch to add the picture of the leaves in the background, but I did not think that the webite itself was very "eyecatching". As you scroll there are more pictures with each of the different categories so that which was good for the overall look of the website. I thought that the Minnesota website was set up well but I think that the menu bar should be larger because it wasn't one of the first things that I saw, more difficult to find compared to Alabama or Massachusetts. I thouhgt that Minnesota did a good job of adjusting the screen when you go from full screen to partial, the pictures that were made for each category were lined up instead of side to side which I thought looked good both large screen and partial. I didn't think that the menu was very easy to spot when not full screen, so when it went partial the menu bar went away and it just went to three bars in the upper left hand corner, which would be harder to find for new users. Overall, the website was average, could use some touchups such as the menu bar when not full screen. </p>
    <h2><a href=https://www.nh.gov/index.htm targets="_blank">4. New Hampshire </a></h2>

    <p><b> New Hampshire Analysis: </b></p>

    <p> New Hapshire had a very interesting set up. I thought that the font of the text at the very top of the websote was cheesy and not something that I would use for a government website. I thought that the information that was not placed in the meniu bar was scattered into boxes towards the bottom of the webisite, which is not a god place to put them. The menu bar was set up well and was at the top of the website and it was easy to navigate. The website itself was not very eye catching, there is just one simple picture of a river with a bridge in the background at the very top. When going into partial screen the website did a good job of keeping the information in the same general area, instead of spreading it out vertiaclly like some of the other websites. The menu itself is not easy to navigate, and the website itself doesn't have much information. </p>
    <h2><a href=https://alaska.gov targets="_blank">5. Alaska </a></h2>

    <p><b> Alaska Analysis: </b></p>
    <p> My least favorite website was Alaska. Alaska was my least favorite because it was very difficult to navigate and I felt that the website itself didn't have much character. It was not eye catching. The only visual aid that it provided for viewers was a mountain with snow on it, which I would guess is in Alaska but it did not state what mountain it was or give any background as to how it was significant. The Links that they provided were very hard to find and are confusing to find. There seemed to be so much information shoved into one page. The one thing that I thought was good was when I made the screen smaller the website did a good job adjusting. Another thing that I thought was strange about the Alaska website was that it had a strang langugae voice recording at the top of the page and it didn't state why that was significant in any way. Overall, the website was not set up well, was not easy to navigate, had random information spewed everywhere, and was not very eye catching. </p>
