    <h1> The Website Opinion Article </h1>

    <h2><a href=https://www.urbanoutfitters.com targets="_blank">1. Urban Outfitters </a></h2>
    <p> Urban Outfitters is one of the most popular clothing companies that has transfromed from a nation-wide comapny to a wrold-wide company. Urban Utfitters is known for its trendy clothes and stylish outfits. Urban Outfitters has created their clothing fanchise from the ground up, not selling any other barnd in their store besides their own. Urban Outfitters webstie is extremeley well set up and easy to navigate. One thing that immediatley caught my eye was the sale sign at the top of the screen which showed some of the best deals that are up to 50% off! I am a consistent shopper and love to see the sale items. The layout makes a lot of sense and there is a scrolling affect. The naviagtion is very well done and not confusing. Everything is laid out very well and the toolbar is clear on where to go when you want to view something you are interested in. One thing that I particularly liked was the imagery on the website. For each item of clothing that they were describing or suggesting, they had imagery to go along with it. For example, one category on their home page was, "Graphic Tees and how to wear them", and above that was a slideshow of different graphic tees that they have for sale and how to wear each one of them. The Text fomrating was also very impressive and there were cool icons that were placed in the webstie as well. When designing this website I believe that the makers of this website were thinking about how to catch users attention while also encouraging them to buy something.The website was laid out into 1 single column. </p>

    <h2><a href=https://www.nike.com targets="_blank">3. Nike </a></h2>
    <p> Nike was a great website! Nike is a very popular clothing, shoe, and sporting goods company that sponsors many sports teams and is the main producer of running and athletic gear! Nikes website is very clean. As you first enter the webstie, there is an inspirational quote that goes along with a picture of a model doing riding a bike wearing nike gear, which looks very majestic as well as inspiring for athletes and people to get up and get active. The Picture itself takes up a good portion of the front page but as you scroll you get to categories to click on, such as fleece, hoodies, and joggers. Nike did not use multiple colors, it mostly used imagery to show users potential things that they would want to buy as well as eye catching outfits that are top sellers. I did notice that Nike used tables, bit what they did was in making the tables the categories were for shoes, and when they were showing the different shoes in the table they inserteda a picture for reference. The tool bar was very easy to navigate and provided everything that a user would be looking for in a orderly fashion. They had good white space use, cool icons, and great imagery. There is a scrolling affect, and website was laid out into 1 column. </p>

    <h2><a href=https://us.shein.com targets="_blank">2. Shein </a></h2>
    <p> Shein is a very poorly made website. Shein is a clothing company that's headquarters are in China and they produce trandy but poorly made clothing. However, Shein is a very popular store that many people buy from everyday. The frist thing that a user would see when accessing this website was the multiple ads that you have to click out of. There were around 3 different ads that pop up in which all were random acess codes to get more sales items even cheaper. The layout does not make any sense and it fails to direct the user to anything that they would be interested in effectively. To find one specfic item it is very difficult and doesnt make much sense. The color scheme is also very boring, there is one color that is used consistently, no other colors were incorporated. The color pink was overused and was the only color utilizied. The formating of this website is very poor and the scrolling affect was put into place, but one thing that was not very easy to naviagte was the toolbar. There are a lot of options and if you were looking for one specific thing it would be very difficult to find. They did however use tables, which looked good with the imagery that they had in place. </p>
